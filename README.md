# Vending-Machine-Simulation
This is a program called "pop" which simulates the operation of a soft drink vending machine. The user running the program will simulate both service and customer actions. The service side will take command line arguments to set the price of the pop. The setting of a valid price will put the machine "in service" allowing for continual customer sale. The program assumes that there is only one flavour of pop, and that the machine won't run out of pop and thus does not track inventory or total sales. As a maintenance action (hidden from menu), the program allows the service person to shutdown (exit) the program altogether at the coin prompt by pressing E or e; refunding any pending amount.
